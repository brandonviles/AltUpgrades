AltUpgrades – v0.2.0
Changelog:

New: Added full weapon proficiency checks per class so you’ll never see upgrades for weapons your alts can’t equip.
Improved: Prevents plate gear from showing as upgrades for cloth wearers (and vice-versa).
Improved: Includes proper Retail enum mapping for all weapon types, fixing “fist weapon” detection.
Fixed: Alts missing class data will now update correctly on login for accurate upgrade checks.
Fixed: Tooltip suggestions now respect both armor type and weapon proficiency for each alt.

Notes:

Weapon restrictions are conservative for Retail and can be loosened in future updates if needed.
If you see something show as an upgrade that shouldn’t be, please note the item and class and report it!
